## Postman API Testing

All initial API development and testing is done through Postman. Of course later on, various
unit/integration/e2e tests would normally be developed, but for APIs, these are the first kind of tests created.

See https://explore.postman.com/lewisasellers for the live version of the tests.

Also, a JSON export is also included in the git repo so that newman can run the tests in CI.
